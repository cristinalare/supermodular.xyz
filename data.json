What if we could rank our causes and only give our money to the most effective? It’s interesting when paired with giving what you can pledge. Con: it only gives to things that have impact today. It only works well at scale. Con: earn-to-give got a damaged reputation after SBF manipulated the idea. Just give along the way as you’re earning. \n\n Challenge: Analyzing impact data is hard. Impact is by nature qualitative, and we’re trying to quantify it. How do you value a sunset vs. oatmeal? It’s all a money-vector. Ethical dilemmas: why our capital goes to the things it does.

Proposals gain voting power the longer the tokens remain staked behind the proposal, and once the proposal meets its threshold, the proposal passes.

It is in opposition to 1:1 as that is plutocratic and based only on capital needs. It is instead based on the number of contributors as opposed to the amount funded, reducing whale power and favoring democratic. \n\n Example: You raise a grant that gets $100 from 100 contributors, and I raise a grant that gets $100 from 1 contributor, despite both grants being donated $100, you will get 99% of the matching pool. It’s a cool mechanism because it is a collective intelligence mechanism that routes money to where the “poor and the many” have an advantage over the rich and the few. \n\n You may give “only” a dollar, but really you are part of building an aggregate signal of what public goods folks want to see funded. Problems: sybil attacks, needing to raise matching pool funds. \n\n It’s like voting! Mitigating a plutocratic methodology with a one person: one vote identity style.",

Web2 = virtue-signaling. Web3 = proof-of-virtue. \n\n So we’re bootstrapping a triple-sided marketplace, where impact DAOs can issue Hypercerts, impact evaluators can stamp their legitimacy, and people who care can purchase them. Sum value is that any impact DAO can go from worrying about how much impact they can capture to how much they can create. That systematically shifts the incentives towards impact DAOs to having a business model, which means more capital and talent can rotate into impact DAOs. If you can create a decentralized signal generation collective intelligence marketplace, where people are issuing, evaluating and purchasing Hypercerts, you can have a decentralized data source about the impact. \n\n Challenge: why haven’t they worked in the past? Impact markets aren’t new. Owocki thinks the decentralized, blockchain aspect will make it reliable and successful. Bootstrapping the buy pressure will be the hardest part. We need to use social and cultural power to collect these things, then they’ll be successful. The dream is to create a market around it.",

    "description": "A bonding curve is a smart contract that mints tokens when money is sent to it and burns tokens to release collateral, and the price of the token goes up with every mint and down with every burn. It solves liquidity issues and price discovery issues for low liquidity markets. You can use them to start up small marketplaces because it’s a single-sided market. Griff declares, bonding curves will win a Nobel Prize as the first single-sided public market! Normally, you need the asset to be sold in order to be bought, but with tokens on a bonding curve, if you want to sell a token on a bonding curve, no one has to buy it. You just send it to the bonding curve, and the bonding curve destroys the token and releases the collateral. \n\n The augmented bonding curve (ABC) adds fees on mint and burn, so when money is sent to the ABC to mint tokens, some of the money goes to a pot of funds that is governed by token holders, and the rest is used to mint tokens. If someone burns a token by sending it to the ABC, some of the money that is released goes to the collective. It’s a continuous market-based funding stream, and as long as there is buying and selling, you’ll have volatility that will lead to public goods funding. \n\n The ABC also adds a “Hatch” in its initialization, where funds are collected before the launch of the bonding curve and some of the funds are used to mint tokens at the same price for all participants, and some of the money goes to the collective. \n\n There is a lot of promise in integrating bonding curves. This is a mechanism that really can push up the price as seen in the example of Moonshop Bot NFTs.",

Anyone can put up a proposal (very easily), and token holders can “bet” (vote) on that proposal, and when they do that, they are “boosting” the proposal up so it gets more attention and even speeds up the process to vote. If that proposal passes, then those who bet on it, will win tokens (Griff says “money”), and those who voted against, lose their stake. \n\n Owocki: This technique takes a holograph of low voter turnout and tries to get a representative turnout. This appears to compete with a delegation model. \n\n Griff: It saves the voters’ attention. Not everyone has time to give to all the proposals and votes. It works well when there are a lot of proposals and too much to pay attention to. It is designed for scalability. \n\n Holographic consensus favors scalability and simultaneously resilience, which are hard to get together. Absolute majority for a proposal is still favored (for resilience) but relative majority can occur under the conditions of “boosting”. Token holders can predict whether or not a proposal will pass in the DAO, thereby betting their tokens accordingly. This continues until either the boosting threshold is met or the boosting period ends. If a proposal reaches the threshold, it only requires a relative majority to pass, and those who’ve bet, gain or lose tokens accordingly. In this way, those who’ve staked act as a prediction market.",

Griff cites a couple examples such as CureCoin and FoldingCoin, which rewards issuance (tokens) for useful proof-of-work, folding proteins, in its efforts to find cures for cancer, Alzheimer’s, and other diseases. The people who fold more proteins get more issuance. It’s great in the digital space because it’s easy to be held accountable to the work that you are doing, but it can be great in the public goods space in a totally different way. Griff loves it as a notable example of something that was originally altruistic and using proof-of-work (work rewards in issuance) to turn it into something economic, what Owocki calls “effective altruism”. \n\n Let’s use some of these other mechanisms to create proof-of-work issuance. When DAO projects do work and then get funding, the funding comes from issuance from the DAO treasury, which is itself a form of proof-of-work issuance. In that way, issuance affects more than just the digital space using this system of public goods building blocks. \n\n There is a nice digression on the difference between issuance and inflation in this section. Bitcoin issues BTC every 10 minutes but still considers itself a deflationary currency. Issuance is the creation of a new currency from nothing, and inflation is the experience of a currency’s value trending downwards relative to other assets.",
